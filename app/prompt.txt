The dock should run on startup and display essential applications, using only black and white icons for a clean, minimalistic look. It should support both horizontal and vertical orientations, with the ability to drag the entire dock around the screen. Users can customize the size of app icons, and while hovering over an icon, it should zoom to 1.2x its original size. The dock should be sleek, user-friendly, and allow for easy rearrangement of icons. The design should be distinct from macOS, offering a more personalized, flexible, and seamless experience on a Windows environment."
